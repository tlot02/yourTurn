Anyone with kids knows that being a parent is not about keeping score **_unless we're counting diapers_**.

As I was joking with some friends I realized that this would be a funny app. So here it is.

Click on "mom" or "dad" each time someone changes a diaper. The app keeps a running counter and changes the background color based on who has changed more diapers.

Each time you click the "mom" or "dad" side, a counter displays the total amount of times each person has changed a diaper
